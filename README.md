# Dash App
This is a demo dashbaord, it provides a simple analysis on Covid-19 confirmed/deaths time-series datasets.

You can find a live demo for the dashboard deployed on heroku, [here](https://dash-app-covid19-mo-yo.herokuapp.com)

Apps deployed on heroku free-tier tend to be slow at first, so you may  
wait a minute before the charts appear and function as intended.
